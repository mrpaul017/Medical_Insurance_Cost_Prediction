I created an automated system using machine learning to estimate the annual medical expenditure for new customers using information or independent variables such as their 
- Age
- Sex 
- BMI 
- Children 
- Smoking habits
- Region of residence.

## Steps in this process:
- Importing and understanding the dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Converting categorical features into numerical
- Model Development 
- Choosing the right Model
- Saving the Model
- Predict on a new data
